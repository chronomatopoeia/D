# Dessication Derby
This is a game.
You are a spunky desert tequila worm. 
In order to grow and not become a desiccated husk in the desert, you must nourish yourself with the life-giving water of the desert cactus. 
This is found only in the top of the cactus. If you hit the border, run into your body or go backwards, you die. 
Mouse click on field to start, arrows to move.
